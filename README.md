# Background
Some say climate change is the biggest threat of our age while others say it’s a myth based on dodgy science.Based on the global temperature data over the past few centuries, we can see that the world is getting warmer. Whether the cause is human activity or natural variability (the preponderance of evidence says it’s humans), thermometer readings all around the world have risen steadily since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.The addition of man-made greenhouse gases to the Atmosphere disturbs the earth's radiative balance. This is leading to an increase in the earth's surface temperature and to related effects on climate, sea level rise and world agriculture. Emissions of CO2 are from burning oil, coal and gas for energy use, burning wood and waste materials, and from industrial processes such as cement production. Emission intensity is the average emission rate of a given pollutant from a given source relative to the intensity of a specific activity.Even data set of crop yield from year 1972 is incorporated here to see how climate change affects the yield of crops.
# Dataset description
I performed an extensive search for the collection of appropriate datasets required to perform the analysis.The first dataset which we acquired from kaggle was created by Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. The data sets contain the temperatures of various different countries across the world and the average gloabal temperatures from 1750 to 2013.Given this complexity, there are a range of organizations that collated the climate trends data. The three most cited land and ocean temperature data sets are NOAA’s MLOST, NASA’s GISTEMP and the UK’s HadCrut.

The Secondary dataset was collected from FAOSTAT, which included crop yeild data of various crops for all the countries from 1965 to 2012. This was an extensive dataset, out of which we have chosen 3 crops: 1) Wheat, 2) Watermelon, 3) Tobacco, to perfom our analysis.

And finally I acquired the green house gas emissons data from data.worldbank.org which is an open source data repository. This data sets consists of the total CO2 emissions and other emissions(HFC, PFC and SF6) from 1970 to 2012.

# Expected Findings
I expect to find a correlation between human activities such as industrialization and rise in global temperatures. Thereby showing that humans collectively are responsible for global warming.

Is cereal production affected by the increase in global temperature in specific regions?

Is higher release in greenhouse gases affecting the yield of crops across different countries?

Has industrilization contributed towards global warming?

Is there a correlation between CO2 emissions and Temperature rise?

How does the temperature vary in developed countries from developing countries?
# Time Series Forecasting
I performed a small part of Time series forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA models which predicts the temperature in upcoming years.
